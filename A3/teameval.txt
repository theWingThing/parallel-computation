                        Team Self Evaluation Form

Each team must submit one copy of this self evaluation form. 
The members of each team should discuss how they
worked together and what to write for the evaluation.

(1) List the names of your team members:

A: Sharon Kuo

 
B: Joseph Woo

 
(2) Estimate how much time each team member devoted to this project.

  	                        A 	       B
meetings 	  	  	3 	       3
coding 	  	  	 	10	       6
writeup 	  	  	4	       3 
planning (alone) 	  	2	       4  	 
total (including meetings) 	19	       16		  	  	 


(3) Describe 
(a) what the major responsibilities of each team member were;
(b) whether or not you completed the assignment;
(c) the major strengths and weaknesses in your team, e.g. how
your team worked together;
(d) the lessons learned from these events;
(e) whether and how you plan to change the way your work together and
(f) anything else that comes to mind.

(a) Joseph was in charge of the overall program design and the chunk
implementation, and Sharon was in charge of optimizing and testing. Of course, we both did all different parts, but those were what we mainly focused on.

(b) We did indeed complete the assignment.

(c) We both did well and did pretty equal shares, but we are both busy and
have conflicting schedules, so we weren't able to meet up as often as we might
like. However, we both worked in the comfort of our own homes, so we are both
happy.

(d) We both were very busy these 2 weeks, so we didn't have as much time to
meet up and discuss what to do.

(e) We probably won't change anything, since we are both pretty satisfied with
the way things worked out.

(f) Nothing as of yet. :)
